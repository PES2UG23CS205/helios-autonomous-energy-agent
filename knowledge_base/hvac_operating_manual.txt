=== HVAC System Model XJ-4000: Technical & Operational Manual ===

## Section 1: System Specifications
- Model: XJ-4000 Commercial Climate Control Unit
- Cooling Capacity: 50,000 BTU/hr
- Heating Capacity: 65,000 BTU/hr
- Recommended Air Filter: MERV 13 Pleated Filter (Part #HF-901B)
- Energy Consumption (Cooling): 4.5 kWh at full load
- Energy Consumption (Heating): 5.2 kWh at full load
- Energy Consumption (Fan Only): 0.5 kWh
- Energy Consumption (Standby): 0.05 kWh

## Section 2: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- SOP-01: Optimal Temperature Ranges
  - Summer / Cooling Season (Occupied): 23°C to 25°C
  - Winter / Heating Season (Occupied): 20°C to 22°C
  - Unoccupied / Night Setback: A 4°C offset is recommended. (e.g., 28°C in summer, 16°C in winter).
- SOP-02: Filter Maintenance
  - Filters must be checked monthly for debris.
  - A mandatory replacement is required every 3 months. A clogged filter can increase energy consumption by up to 15% due to reduced airflow.
- SOP-03: Pre-Cooling and Pre-Heating
  - The system is capable of 'ramping' to a target temperature.
  - Pre-cooling/heating should commence 90 minutes before scheduled occupancy to ensure comfort upon arrival.

## Section 3: High-Load State & System Alerts
- The XJ-4000 model is considered a 'high-load' appliance.
- System Alert 'YELLOW': Indicates filter efficiency is below 50%. Schedule maintenance.
- System Alert 'RED': Indicates compressor strain or overheating. Requires immediate shutdown and professional service.
- The unit automatically participates in load shedding when it receives a 'DR-02' signal from the Building Management System (BMS).
